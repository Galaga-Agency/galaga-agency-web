      "intro": "We transformed a scattered business ecosystem into an integrated digital platform, connecting CRM, ERP and web through intelligent automations to boost operational efficiency and commercial visibility.",
      "challenge": "Dos x Dos started from a scattered landscape — manual processes, an unintegrated ERP (Navision), absence of CRM and a static website that didn't reflect the brand's sophistication or help position it in search engines. This lack of digitalization limited operational efficiency, commercial visibility and the ability to make data-driven decisions, hampering competitiveness in an increasingly demanding market.",
      "solution": "To reverse this we implemented Zoho CRM, migrated to A3 ERP and connected them to a Notion space that orchestrates projects and automations; all of this is integrated through a unified API. In parallel, we developed a new website with Next.js and its own content panel, optimized for SEO and Core Web Vitals.",

      "challenge": "Energía Solar Canarias started from multiple unconnected tools: clients had to consult different energy providers separately on independent platforms. There was no proprietary platform that consolidated data or a CRM that organized users, plants or alerts. This fragmentation prevented controlling prices and calculating savings accurately, complicated mobile access and overwhelmed the team with manual tasks, eroding the brand's digital experience.",
      "solution": "To reverse this, a progressive web application was developed that unifies all providers in a single responsive interface and a CRM connected to the ERP was created, with dashboards, workflows and automatic data synchronization.",
      "result": "Now clients monitor production, consumption and savings in real time, receive personalized alerts, and the company reduces manual work, makes data-driven decisions and improves energy efficiency, generating economic savings and lower carbon footprint."

      "solution": "Galaga conceived and produced a free event with tournaments, simulators, VR, influencers and continuous dynamization during three days.",
